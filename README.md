# Numerical-Analysis 

This repository contains my study note of numerical analysis. The jupyter notebook includes important definitions and theorems of numerical analysis, most examples in the textbook which are rewritten and implemented in Python and code for computer problems.

## Requirements

- [python(v3.8.6+)](https://www.python.org/)
- [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
- [mpmath](http://mpmath.org/)

It is recommended to use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) for Jupyter notebooks and code.
